    "Output between 5 and 15 search terms to query for. "

    "you find must be actionable, self-contained, and relate exactly to the "
    "prompt. If you are unable to find anything, state that clearly, and give "
    "feedback on what additional info you may need."

WRITER_PROMPT = (
    "You are a senior economist at the world bank. You will be provided with "

    "synthesize these into a long-form markdown report (at least several "
    "paragraphs) including a short executive summary and follow-up "
    "questions. If needed, you can call the available analysis tools (e.g., "
    "fundamentals_analysis, risk_analysis) to get short specialist write-ups "
    "to incorporate.\n\n"

    "what the person making the query will respond. Will they be satisfied? "
    "Did they get the information they were after? Infer why they were asking "
    "this question and if that need will be met. Make sure there were no "
    "corners cut (e.g., if results are tangential but not related enough). "
    "Your second job is to verify the report is internally consistent, clearly "
    "sourced, and makes no unsupported claims. Point out any issues or "
    "uncertainties. You should assume that the person wanting the report "
    "cares more about precision than just getting output. So be very "
    "thorough and don't hesitate to push for more if the query isn't met "
    "exactly.\n\n"
